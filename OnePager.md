Keygate is a multi-chain aggregation protocol that enables one-click cross-chain intent execution and atomic swaps within the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Our responsibility is to:
Provide integrators with comprehensive data regarding chains, tokens, decentralized exchanges, and bridges.
Find all possible routes between an origin chain and a destination chain, suggesting an optimal route (cheapest or fastest).
Allow integrators to execute single-hop or multi-hop routes with an optional execution step, within a single batch transaction (i.e, a single transaction for a cross-chain "swap and stake" intent)

State of the Market
Cross-chain swaps within the ICP ecosystem currently require 1-3 separate transactions across different user experiences, creating friction for users and developers. Existing bridges like OneSec and ckBridge lack the automation needed for seamless cross-chain intent execution.

Objective
Take responsibility for finding optimal routes from origin to destination chains, executing cross-chain swaps atomically, and providing a unified interface that abstracts away the complexity of multi-chain operations.

Solution
Keygate aggregates all available routes, calculates optimal paths based on cost/speed preferences, and executes cross-chain intents in a single batch transaction, eliminating the need for multiple user interactions across different platforms.

Key Benefits
- One-click cross-chain execution
- Atomic multi-hop transactions
- Unified developer experience
- Cost and time optimization
- Reduced user friction
