## Setup your development

Learn how to integrate Keygate SDK into your application for seamless cross-chain payments.

### Install and configure

Install the Keygate SDK package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @keygate/sdk
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @keygate/sdk
```

Keygate SDK requires several peer dependencies for wallet management and cross-chain functionality:

```bash
npm install wagmi viem @tanstack/react-query @lifi/sdk
```

Make sure you have React 18\+ and TypeScript 4.9\+ installed in your project.

Set up your environment variables for the Keygate SDK:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFI_API_KEY=your_lifi_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=1
```

You can get a LiFi API key from their [dashboard](https://li.fi/).

### Get started in 5 minutes

Wrap your application with the required providers for wallet management and Keygate functionality:

```tsx
import { KeygateProvider } from '@keygate/sdk';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <WagmiProvider config={wagmiConfig}>
        <KeygateProvider>
          {/* Your app components */}
        </KeygateProvider>
      </WagmiProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

Use the PayButton component to enable cross-chain payments in your application:

```tsx
import { PayButton } from '@keygate/sdk';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <PayButton
      toAmount="100"
      toAddress="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
      fromCurrency="USDC"
      toCurrency="USDC"
      toAlias="Alice"
      toFallbackAddress="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
    />
  );
}
```

The PayButton component is fully customizable with CSS classes and supports dark mode:

```tsx
<PayButton
  toAmount="50"
  toAddress="0x..."
  fromCurrency="USDC"
  toCurrency="USDC"
  className="custom-pay-button"
/>
```

The component automatically handles wallet connection, transaction estimation, and execution.

## Payment Flow

The Keygate SDK implements a streamlined payment flow that handles the complexity of cross-chain transactions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User clicks PayButton">
    The user clicks the PayButton component, which opens the TransactionModal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet connection">
    If not connected, the user selects and connects their wallet (MetaMask supported).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transaction estimation">
    The SDK estimates gas costs, fees, and execution time for the cross-chain transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User confirmation">
    The user reviews the transaction details and confirms the payment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cross-chain execution">
    The SDK executes the transaction using LiFi's cross-chain infrastructure.
  </Step>
