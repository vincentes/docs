# Introduction

Keygate SDK enables developers from the Internet Computer Protocol to tap into liquidity from diverse ecosystems via cross-chain swaps and bridging within these applications. Our SDK is built for TypeScript/JavaScript environments, allowing you to quickly integrate our protocol into your existing frontend or backend. Keygate SDK manages communication with the protocol's canisters, smart contracts, and APIs, making it quick and simple to integrate with.

As of today, our features include:

- Requesting possible routes from Internet Computer Protocol (inflows and outflows)
- Executing a route
- Tracking the status of a cross-chain swap (via a webhook)
- Supports industry standards, including EIP-5792, ERC-2612, EIP-712, and Permit2.
- Integrated with well-established and state-of-the-art frontend libraries. (Viem, Wallet Standard, Bigmi).
- Support for transaction calls on a destination chain.
