Keygate supports the following chains for token swapping and bridging (with more coming soon):

| Chain Name                 | Chain ID        | Inflows | Outflows |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Ethereum                   | 1               | ✅       | ✅        |
| Base                       | 8453            | ✅       | ✅        |
| Arbitrum                   | 42161           | ✅       | ✅        |
| Internet Computer Protocol | 121171651099711 | ✅       | ✅        |

# **Get available chains**

`getChains`

Fetches a list of all available chains supported by the Keygate SDK.

**Parameters**

- `params` (ChainRequest, optional): Specify which chains you are interested in integrating into your dApp.
  - `chainTypes` A filter to select the type of chains to support. e.g `ChainType.EVM`, `ChainType.ICP`. 

**Returns**

A promise that resolves to an array of `ExtendedChain` objects.

```typescript
import { ChainType, getChains } from '@keygate/sdk';

try {
  const chains = await getChains({ chainTypes: [ChainType.EVM] });
  console.log(chains);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
