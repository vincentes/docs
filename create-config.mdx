## Create Config

To get started, you need to create an initial configuration for the Keygate SDK. This configuration contains the shared settings and data required for the proper functioning of other SDK features that developers will use. Additionally, the configuration can be updated later as needed.

```typescript
import { createConfig } from '@keygate/sdk'

createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
})
```

## Configuration Options

The `createConfig` function accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

**integrator** `string` `required`

A unique identifier for your dApp or company. This helps Keygate track usage and provide support when needed.

## Example Usage

Here's a complete example of how to set up the Keygate SDK configuration:

```typescript
import { createConfig } from '@keygate/sdk'

// Initialize the SDK with your configuration
createConfig({
  integrator: 'MyAwesomeDApp',
})

// Now you can use other SDK functions like getRoutes, getQuote, etc.
```

## Next Steps

Once you've configured the SDK, you can:

- [Request routes and quotes](/routes) to find the best cross-chain paths
- [Execute routes](/execute-routes) to perform actual swaps and bridges
- Explore the [API reference](/api-reference) for detailed function documentation
