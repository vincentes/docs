## What is Keygate?

Applications on emerging blockchains face a significant challenge: limited liquidity and adoption due to the difficulty of bringing external assets onto the chain. This hinders growth for NFTs, DeFi, P2E games, and other innovative ICP dApps.

Keygate provides a powerful protocol and SDK that enables applications in niche markets to easily accept cryptocurrency from over 10 different blockchains. We handle all of the necessary conversions and cross-chain asset transfers allowing for a quick and secure transaction.
