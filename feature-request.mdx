Keygate's documentation shows features that are publicly available, but we have features that are available in-house and flagged as private. Our philosophy is to launch based on integrators need, on-demand, to ensure we provide features that align with market needs as effectively as possible.

# List of requestable features

- **Token Prices:** We have an API that calculates prices of the Internet Computer Protocol's tokens. Current solutions are quite limited so we are also solving this.
- **Token Balance:** Request a principal or wallet addresses's balance via our API.
- **On-chain variant of the API:** If desired, we can provide access to [tapi.keygate.io](http://tapi.keygate.io) which is the threshold ECDSA equivalent of [api.keygate.io](api.keygate.io).
- **And more\! Just ask.**
